InitEditableContents plugin
===========================

On standard behaviour the plugin will automatically prefill empty editables with p-tags. You can specify your on regular expressions and replacements for each editalbe to tackle more sophisticated replacements, like replacing all occurences of "Aloha" by "Aloha-Editor" (well, ok, this is not tooo challenging either...).

View plugin.js for config examples.
